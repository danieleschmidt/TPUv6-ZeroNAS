# TPUv6-ZeroNAS
TPUv6-ZeroNAS pioneers predictive neural architecture search for unreleased hardware. By learning performance regression models from Edge TPU v5e counters, we accurately predict v6 latency/energy before silicon arrivesâ€”enabling day-zero deployment of optimized models achieving the rumored 75 TOPS/W efficiency target.
