The merge conflict has been resolved. The key changes made:

1. **Combined defensive programming with clean implementation**: Kept the defensive `getattr()` calls from HEAD for accessing `scaling_law_coeffs` attributes with fallbacks
2. **Enhanced width handling**: Added robust width detection that handles both `avg_width` and `max_channels` attributes, with fallback to computing from layers
3. **Preserved functionality**: Maintained all features from both versions including uncertainty quantification and error handling
4. **Fixed the try-except structure**: Properly wrapped the entire method in a single try-catch block from HEAD

The resolved version safely handles different architecture attribute configurations while maintaining the clean logic flow from PR-15.
