# TPUv6-ZeroNAS Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in TPUv6-ZeroNAS.

## Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation
- All CLI inputs are validated against reasonable ranges
- File paths are sanitized to prevent path traversal
- Numeric inputs have upper and lower bounds
- String inputs are checked for suspicious patterns

### 2. Safe File Operations
- All file operations use Path objects for safety
- Write operations are restricted to designated output directories
- No arbitrary file system access is permitted

### 3. Import Security
- Only whitelisted modules can be imported
- No dynamic code execution (eval/exec) except for safe detection patterns
- All imports are statically analyzable

### 4. Resource Limits
- Maximum iterations: 10,000
- Maximum population size: 500
- Maximum memory usage: 8GB
- File size limits: 100MB

### 5. Error Handling
- All exceptions are caught and logged appropriately
- No sensitive information is exposed in error messages
- Graceful degradation on security violations

## Compliance
This implementation follows security best practices for:
- OWASP Top 10 mitigations
- Static analysis compliance
- Zero-trust architecture principles

## Reporting Security Issues
Security issues should be reported through appropriate channels.
